# dsc291-linearAlgebra


To run the baselines related to linear algebra, use the notebook  `matrixfactorization_notebook.ipynb` 
The notebook has been properly commented and divided into sections for explaining everything. 

To run the transformers based models, use the file `transformersTrain.py`. 
It runs the code on the given datasets. The file has been commented to provide appropriate pointers.
Also, the logs for the same are present oin twitterCovidKaggleLogs.
